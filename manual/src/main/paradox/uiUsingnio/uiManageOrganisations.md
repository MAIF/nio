# Manage Organisations

The organization is a logical entity, as for example Maif, Altima ... Groups can be defined in an organization, as for example within the Maif organization one can have a Maif group and a Maif partner group. Permissions are defined for each of these groups (for example contact by e-mail, phone ...) Version management is done in draft or publication.The draft version can be published, so it will become non-modifiable but a new draft version will be created.
